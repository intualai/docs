# Projects

Projects are the organizational foundation of IntualAI. They help you group related workflows, integrations, and business processes together, making it easier to manage complex automation scenarios and collaborate with your team.

## What Are Projects?

Projects are containers that organize your IntualAI resources into logical groups. Each project can contain multiple workflows, integrations, Functions, and data objects that work together to solve specific business problems or automate particular processes.
