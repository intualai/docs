# Workflows

Workflows are the heart of IntualAI's automation capabilities. They allow you to create sophisticated, multi-step processes that can handle complex business logic, make intelligent decisions, and automate tasks across your entire organization.

## What Are Workflows?

Workflows are visual, drag-and-drop automation sequences that connect multiple Functions together to create powerful business processes. Think of them as digital assembly lines that can process data, make decisions, and take actions automatically.

## Key Features

### Visual Builder
Create workflows using our intuitive drag-and-drop interface. No coding requiredâ€”just connect Functions together to build your automation logic.

### AI-Powered Decision Making
Incorporate AI Functions into your workflows to make intelligent decisions based on data analysis, sentiment, and business rules.

### Real-time Execution
Workflows run in real-time, processing data as it comes in and taking immediate action when conditions are met.

### Error Handling
Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms ensure your workflows are reliable and resilient to failures.

### Monitoring & Analytics
Track workflow performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize your automation processes with detailed analytics.

## Workflow Components

### Triggers
Events that start your workflow, such as:
- New data arriving from an integration
- Scheduled time intervals
- Manual activation
- Webhook calls from external systems

### Functions
The building blocks of your workflow that perform specific actions:
- Data processing and transformation
- API calls to external services
- Database operations
- AI-powered analysis
- Notification sending

### Conditions
Logic gates that control workflow flow:
- If/then/else statements
- Data validation checks
- Threshold comparisons
- AI-powered decision making

### Actions
The final steps that complete your workflow:
- Sending notifications
- Updating databases
- Creating records in external systems
- Triggering other workflows

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Customer Onboarding
Automate the entire customer onboarding process:
1. **Trigger**: New customer signup
2. **Function**: Validate customer data
3. **Function**: Create accounts in multiple systems
4. **Function**: Send welcome emails
5. **Function**: Assign customer success manager
6. **Action**: Notify team of new customer

### Data Processing Pipeline
Process and analyze incoming data:
1. **Trigger**: New data from integration
2. **Function**: Clean and validate data
3. **Function**: AI enrichment and analysis
4. **Function**: Store processed results
5. **Function**: Generate insights
6. **Action**: Send alerts for anomalies

### Automated Reporting
Generate and distribute reports automatically:
1. **Trigger**: Scheduled time (daily/weekly)
2. **Function**: Query multiple data sources
3. **Function**: Process and aggregate data
4. **Function**: Generate visualizations
5. **Function**: Format report
6. **Action**: Send to stakeholders

### Intelligent Alerting
Monitor systems and respond to issues:
1. **Trigger**: Data threshold exceeded
2. **Function**: Analyze severity and context
3. **Function**: Determine appropriate response
4. **Function**: Execute corrective actions
5. **Function**: Escalate if needed
6. **Action**: Notify relevant team members

## Advanced Capabilities

### Parallel Processing
Run multiple Functions simultaneously to improve performance and handle complex scenarios.

### Conditional Branching
Create multiple paths through your workflow based on data conditions or AI analysis.

### Loops and Iterations
Process multiple items or repeat actions until conditions are met.

### Error Recovery
Automatically retry failed operations or execute alternative paths when errors occur.

### Integration Chaining
Connect workflows together to create sophisticated automation networks.
