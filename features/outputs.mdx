# Outputs

Outputs are the final step in your IntualAI workflowsâ€”the way you deliver results, share insights, and take action based on your automated processes. Whether you need to send notifications, generate reports, or update external systems, IntualAI provides powerful output capabilities to ensure your automation delivers real value.

## What Are Outputs?

Outputs are the actions that happen at the end of your workflows or Functions. They take the processed data and insights from your automation and turn them into tangible results that drive your business forward.
