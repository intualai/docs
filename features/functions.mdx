title: Functions
description: Learn how IntualAI's core functions are the engine for our entire business operations platform—from BI dashboards and intelligent alerts to AI agents and automated workflows.
---

In IntualAI, we view your business as a living ecosystem of data, processes, and insights. To orchestrate this ecosystem, you need powerful, fundamental actions. **Functions are those actions.**

They are the modular, reusable, server-side utilities that serve as the core engine for the entire IntualAI platform. They are the "verbs" that act upon your data "nouns" (Objects), enabling you to monitor, analyze, and automate your operations with unparalleled flexibility.

## How Functions Power the IntualAI Platform

Functions are not just for workflows; they are the foundational technology that makes the entire orchestration platform possible.

<CardGroup>
  <Card
    title="Powering BI Dashboards"
  >
    Your BI dashboards aren't static reports. Each chart, metric, and table tile is powered by Functions like `Database Query` or `API Request` running behind the scenes to fetch the latest data, ensuring your view of the business is always live.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Driving AI & Chat"
  >
    When you ask our AI chat a question or an agent performs a "Vibe Check," they are using a chain of Functions to understand your intent, query the relevant data objects, and synthesize an intelligent answer. Through tool calls, the chat can actually perform actions to accelerate your business operations.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Enabling Intelligent Alerting"
  >
    Our intelligent alerting system uses the `Evaluator` function to constantly monitor your metrics against defined thresholds. When a condition is met, a Function is what triggers the alarm and orchestrates the notification process.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Automating Workflows"
  >
    And yes, Functions are the heart of our automation engine. You can chain them together in our visual builder to create powerful workflows that handle your most complex, end-to-end business processes.

## Vibe Analysis & Actionable Intelligence

Beyond traditional analytics, IntualAI's Functions enable **vibe analysis** of your business operations. Our AI can analyze the overall "vibe" of your business by examining patterns across multiple data sources and then take immediate action through tool calls.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Real-time Vibe Assessment"
  >
    Continuously analyze customer sentiment, operational efficiency, and market trends to understand the current "vibe" of your business across all touchpoints.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Intelligent Tool Calls"
  >
    When the AI detects opportunities or issues, it can automatically execute Functions to take action—sending notifications, updating databases, or triggering workflows without human intervention.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Proactive Business Acceleration"
  >
    Instead of just reporting on what happened, our AI actively accelerates your business by performing the right actions at the right time based on real-time analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Contextual Decision Making"
  >
    The AI understands your business context and can make informed decisions about which actions to take, when to take them, and how to optimize for maximum impact.
  </Card>
